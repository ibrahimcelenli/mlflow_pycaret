## üìã **How It Works**

1. **Model Training**  
   - A Turkish sentiment analysis dataset is loaded and processed.  
   - PyCaret is used to compare models, finalize the best-performing one, and save it.  

2. **User Interface**  
   - Users enter text in the Streamlit app.  
   - The trained model predicts the sentiment and returns the result.  

3. **Model Logging**  
   - Experiment parameters, metrics, and the model are logged using MLflow.
